# About Lev Goncharov

![about](assets/about.jpeg?raw=true)

* [Simple Engineer Notes](https://t.me/simpleEngineerNotes)
* **In real life**: cyclist, camper, engineer & coffee person.
* **At work**: As an infrastructure simplifying engineer, I've seen infrastructure from completely different points of view: as a system administrator, software-defined storage developer, and DevOps engineer. Fortunately, there's an unchanged part. I believe that infrastructure is code and therefore we must use the same philosophy for infrastructure as for software development.
