# GPT 4 IaC

*Date: 2025-02-12*

I've made some practical experiments with GPT in the IaC context and [gave a speech about that at the meetup](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7275537157463699458/) and [DevConf](https://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/talk/R7VQXB/).

I'm using chatGPT like solutions in real life for different purpose:

- Read laws/documents and share the result.
- Write "official" letters in foreign languages (Spanish/Catalan).
- Translate words/abbreviations with multiple meanings.
- Analyze medical historical data and provide forecasts.

And I realized **üî• it works well**. But what's about the IaC? is it usefull?

## Limitations

There are many solutions available publicly:

- [Phind](https://www.phind.com/)
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)
- [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)
- [There's an AI for That](https://theresanaiforthat.com/)
- [GigaChat](https://gigachat.app/)
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/)
- [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com)

However, I've decided to limit myself to Copilot because it integrates smoothly with VSCode and is allowed for use. The main limitation is that **only public data is allowed**.

## Usecases

### @ work: Documentations & presentations

**Goal:** Fluent, easy-to-read texts without mistakes.

**Pros:**

- Can rephrase and increase readability.
- Can propose reasonable grammar and syntax changes.
- Applicable for [presentations as code](https://www.goncharov.xyz/life/how-to-make-speech-en.html).

**Cons:**

- None identified

**Conclusion:** üî• it works well.

### @ work: create ansible lookup plugin

**Goal:** Transform the script `get-latest-version.py` to an Ansible lookup plugin. The purpose of the script was to:

- Connect to a Maven repository.
- Search for the artifact according to some rules.
- Print the artifact version.

**Pros:**

- Can generate the boilerplate but not ideal.
- Can propose reasonable syntax changes.

**Cons:**

- Suggested fixes can have wrong logic or indentation.

**Conclusion:** ‚úÖ ok to use for well known domain area.

### @ work: generate documentation

**Goal:** Avoid boring tasks.

**Pros:**

- Can generate human-friendly, readable documentation.

**Cons:**

- Suggested fixes can have wrong logic or indentation.

**Conclusion:** ‚úÖ it works well.

### @ work: explain jinja2 expressions

**Goal:** Understand written templates.

**Pros:**

- Explain step by step what's happening.

**Cons:**

- The context is required.

**Conclusion:** ‚úÖ ok to use for well known domain area.

### @ work: debug Ansible OTC dynamic inventory plugin

**Goal:** Get list of VMs from OTC in Ansible friendly format.

**Pros:**

- Can generate suitable config.

**Cons:**

- Not enough knowledge about OTC and suggests non-existent parameters.
- Unable to identify the root cause of connection failures.
- **It is very easy to send secrets to third parties**.

**Conclusion:** ‚õîÔ∏è fail.

### @ work: fix errors in Ansible roles

**Goal:** Fix errors during Java installation.

**Pros:**

- It proposed correct changes.

**Cons:**

- Some iterations are required.
- It doesn't know about infrastructure.

**Conclusion:** ‚ùì acceptable.

### @ work: explain dependencies across the project

**Goal:** Understand infrastructure dependencies across the different parts.

**Pros:**

- Not identified.

**Cons:**

- Doesn't know the entire project context.
- It doesn't support whole project as a context.

**Conclusion:** ‚õîÔ∏è doesn't work.

# Copilot 4: summary

| Pros                          | Cons                              |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Improves readability          | Lacks context                     |
| Proposes syntax changes       | Possible errors in suggestions    |
| Generates documentation       | Requires iterations               |
| Step-by-step explanations     | Limited knowledge                 |
| Generates configurations      | Unable to identify root causes    |

**Conclusion:** ‚ùóÔ∏èjust imagine that there is very smart junior in your team.

## Ideas

In case of IaC I'm following [IDLC](https://www.goncharov.xyz/it/idlc-en.html)(SDLC for IaC) approach and I think it can be improved.

### üí° Idea: PR reviewer

![](./assets/idlc.png?raw=true)

Make GPT as an optional reviewer in a repo:

1. Get the diff.
2. Load affected files as context.
3. Provide prompt: "review it".
4. Suggest changes to PR.

**Conclusion:** ‚ùóÔ∏è [IDLC](idlc-en.md) can be improved.

### üí° Idea: Increase IaC test coverage

![](./assets/200k_testing_pyramid.png?raw=true)

There is [IaC testing pyramid](200k-iac-en.md) concept. It describes how to test IaC. The problem is that it's slow or just linting. The idea is that maybe it will be possible to add gpt to Static Analysis level. I.e. simulate an ansible or terraform execution without real execution. Maybe it will be faster or cheaper.

**Conclusion:** ‚ùóÔ∏è [IaC testing](ansible-testing-en.md) can be improved.
